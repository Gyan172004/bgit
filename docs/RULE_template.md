## 1. Summary

> A short, one-liner describing the intent and scope of this rule.

## 2. Scope

- [ ] Miscellaneous

### Trigger Point (When to Check):
> _e.g., Before `git add`, After `git commit`, Before push, etc._

- **Example**: This rule must run **before** `git add` to prevent staging `.env` files.

- Refer to [`../src/events`](../src/events/) for the complete list of possible trigger events. If the relevant trigger is not listed, explicitly mention it and consider updating the reference list.

## 3. Motivation

### Problem Statement:
Explain the problem or risks this rule is designed to prevent.

### Objectives:
- Goal 1  
- Goal 2  
- Goal 3  

### Common Pitfall:
Example of how someone might accidentally break the rule.

## 4. Rule Definition

- [ ] High (code breakage, data loss)  
- [ ] Critical (security/legal risk)

## 7. Enforcement Strategy

### Pseudocode / Workflow
```bash
# Example enforcement logic
<your script or logic here>
```

### Suggested Tooling:
- Git hooks (shell, Python, etc.)
- CI pipeline checks
- Regex-based matchers
- Static analysis/linting
- Custom CLI scripts

## 8. Possible Fixes

List known strategies or automated fixes to resolve violations of this rule.

### Manual Fix:
> _Describe what a developer should do manually to fix the issue._

git reset .env
```

- If no automated fix is available, write `None`.
