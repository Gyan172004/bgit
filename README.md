bgit is a simplified wrapper for Git, designed specifically for absolute beginners who find the Git workflow daunting. It automates common Git tasks such as adding, committing, and pushing changes, while also incorporating smart rules to prevent common issues like accidentally adding sensitive files or directories such as `.env` or `node_modules`.

## Features

- **Simplified Workflow**: bgit streamlines the Git workflow by guiding users through common tasks using intuitive command-line prompts.
- **Smart Rules**: bgit incorporates intelligent rules to prevent common mistakes, ensuring that only relevant files are added and committed.
- **Extensible**: Users can easily extend bgit's functionality to suit their specific needs by adding custom rules or commands.
- **Complex Command Support**: bgit allows users to run complex Git commands easily, abstracting away the complexities for beginners.

## Installation

> [!WARNING]
> Windows compilation is broken, as `hook_executor` is not implemented yet for that platform! Fix on the way :wink:

bgit is written in Rust, ensuring fast performance and reliability. To install bgit, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have Rust installed. You can install Rust using rustup by following the instructions on [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs/).
2. Run

    ```bash
    cargo install bgit
    ```

## Getting Started

To start using bgit, navigate to your Git repository directory in your terminal and simply run `bgit`. bgit will guide you through the necessary steps to add, commit, and push your changes.

Here's a basic example of how to use bgit:

```bash
bgit
```

Follow the on-screen prompts to add, commit, and push your changes. bgit will handle the rest, ensuring that only relevant files are included and that your Git repository remains clean and organized.
